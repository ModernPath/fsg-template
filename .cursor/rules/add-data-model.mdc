# Data Model Security Patterns

This document describes the security patterns and policies for different types of resources in our Next.js application using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS).

Generic instructions on adding a new datamodel:
1. Always read [datamodel.md](mdc:docs/datamodel.md) for existing datamodel description and [description.md](mdc:docs/description.md) for overall description of the app
2. Implement a new migration file using supabase cli
3. Construct the datamodel using guidance in this file
4. Run the data migration locally using supabase db push in cli

## ⚠️ CRITICAL MIGRATION RULES ⚠️

**NEVER MODIFY EXISTING MIGRATION FILES**

Migration files are immutable once created. They represent the historical state of the database at a specific point in time.

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```bash
# Always create a NEW migration file
supabase migration new fix_user_role_enum

# Supabase will create a timestamped file like:
# supabase/migrations/20251111200830_fix_user_role_enum.sql
```

**❌ WRONG APPROACH:**
```bash
# NEVER edit existing migration files like:
# supabase/migrations/20251111153836_create_bizexit_phase2_tables.sql
```

**WHY?**
- Existing migrations may have already been applied in production
- Modifying them breaks the migration history
- Team members may have different database states
- Git history and rollbacks become unreliable

**IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING:**
1. Create a new migration file
2. Add SQL to modify the existing structure
3. Use `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP`, `CREATE` statements as needed

If you need to reset the whole database, always ask before doing it.
Reset by: supabase db reset
After reset run all db inilisations as described in [README.md](mdc:README.md)

## Access Levels

### 1. Public Access
Resources that are accessible to all users without authentication.

```sql
-- Basic public read access
create policy "Public read access"
  on table_name for select
  using ( true );

-- Public read access with conditions
create policy "Public read access with conditions"
  on table_name for select
  using ( 
    published = true and 
    expires_at > now() 
  );

-- Public create access with validation
create policy "Public create access"
  on table_name for insert
  with check (
    char_length(name) >= 2 and
    email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'
  );
```

### 2. Authenticated Access
Resources that require user authentication but not specific roles.

```sql
-- Basic authenticated access
create policy "Authenticated read access"
  on table_name for select
  using ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

-- Owner-based access
create policy "Owner access"
  on table_name for all
  using ( auth.uid() = user_id );

-- Team-based access
create policy "Team access"
  on table_name for all
  using (
    auth.uid() in (
      select member_id 
      from team_members 
      where team_id = table_name.team_id
    )
  );
```

### 3. Admin Access
Resources that require admin privileges.

```sql
-- Admin-only access
create policy "Admin access"
  on table_name for all
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );

-- Admin or owner access
create policy "Admin or owner access"
  on table_name for all
  using (
    auth.uid() = user_id or
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

## Policy Patterns

### 1. Content Management
```sql
-- Published content visible to all
create policy "Public can view published content"
  on content for select
  using ( published = true );

-- Draft content visible to authors and admins
create policy "Authors and admins can view drafts"
  on content for select
  using (
    auth.uid() = author_id or
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );

-- Only authors can create content
create policy "Authors can create content"
  on content for insert
  with check ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

-- Only authors can update their content
create policy "Authors can update own content"
  on content for update
  using ( auth.uid() = author_id );
```

### 2. User Data Management
```sql
-- Users can view own data
create policy "Users can view own data"
  on user_data for select
  using ( auth.uid() = user_id );

-- Users can update own data
create policy "Users can update own data"
  on user_data for update
  using ( auth.uid() = user_id )
  with check (
    case
      when auth.uid() = user_id then true
      else false
    end
  );

-- Admins can view all user data
create policy "Admins can view all user data"
  on user_data for select
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

### 3. Media Management
```sql
-- Public can view media
create policy "Public can view media"
  on media_assets for select
  using ( true );

-- Users can upload media
create policy "Users can upload media"
  on media_assets for insert
  with check (
    auth.uid() = user_id and
    file_size <= 10485760 and  -- 10MB limit
    mime_type in ('image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp')
  );

-- Users can manage own media
create policy "Users can manage own media"
  on media_assets for all
  using ( auth.uid() = user_id );
```

### 4. Analytics and Logging
```sql
-- Anyone can create analytics events
create policy "Public can create analytics"
  on analytics_events for insert
  with check ( true );

-- Only admins can view analytics
create policy "Admins can view analytics"
  on analytics_events for select
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Blog System
```sql
-- Posts table policies
create policy "Public can view published posts"
  on posts for select using ( published = true );

create policy "Authors can view all own posts"
  on posts for select using ( auth.uid() = author_id );

create policy "Authors can create posts"
  on posts for insert
  with check ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

create policy "Authors can update own posts"
  on posts for update using ( auth.uid() = author_id );

-- Comments table policies
create policy "Public can view comments"
  on comments for select using ( true );

create policy "Authenticated users can create comments"
  on comments for insert
  with check ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

create policy "Users can update own comments"
  on comments for update using ( auth.uid() = author_id );
```

### 2. Contact Form System
```sql
-- Contacts table policies
create policy "Anyone can create contacts"
  on contacts for insert
  with check ( true );

create policy "Only authenticated users can view contacts"
  on contacts for select
  using ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

create policy "Only admins can update contacts"
  on contacts for update
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

### 3. Translation System
```sql
-- Languages table policies
create policy "Public can view enabled languages"
  on languages for select
  using ( enabled = true );

create policy "Admins can manage languages"
  on languages for all
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid()
      and is_admin = true
    )
  );

-- Translations table policies
create policy "Public can view translations"
  on translations for select using ( true );

create policy "Only authenticated users can manage translations"
  on translations for all
  using ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Policy Design
- Start with most restrictive access
- Use row-level security for all tables
- Implement policies for each operation type
- Consider performance impact of complex policies
- Use appropriate policy combinations

### 2. Security Considerations
- Always enable RLS
- Use service role sparingly
- Validate all user input
- Use appropriate policy granularity
- Implement proper error handling

### 3. Performance
- Keep policies simple when possible
- Index columns used in policies
- Use materialized views for complex queries
- Monitor policy performance
- Cache frequently accessed data

### 4. Testing
- Test all access patterns
- Verify policy combinations
- Test edge cases
- Use proper test data
- Monitor policy changes
